### Idea
A simple BNF parser that is created by higher order functions.

### Algorithms
Darboux Parser features two main algorithms:
1. ```matcher```
2. ```interval_matcher```

### Extension
Interval matching - matching of strings first

### Set Up
```shell
$ python3 parser.py
```

### Remark
The name Darboux was chosen because the author was studying partitions under the topic of Darboux integral in MATH 104.
