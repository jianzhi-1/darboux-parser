### Idea
A simple BNF parser that is created by higher order functions.
A bit of look back capability for Regex.

### Algorithms
Darboux Parser features two main algorithms:
1. ```matcher```
2. ```interval_matcher```

### Extension
Interval matching - matching of strings first
Do a comparison of the run time on the ( correct ) correct
Read from files?

### Running and Testing
```shell
$ python3 parser.py
```

Some tests have been provided. **WARNING**: running the large test cases may take ~17 seconds.
```shell
$ sh test_small.sh
$ sh test_large.sh
```

### Remarks
The name Darboux was chosen because the author was studying partitions under the topic of Darboux integral in MATH 104.
